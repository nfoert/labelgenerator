# nfoert's Label Generator
I had a large event at my home, and some people have various allergies, so I decided to create a script that automatically generates labels for food. You can specify if it's Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten Free, Nut Free or Dairy Free.

This was a quick and dirty project and I'll be improving it soon, It's sort of buggy right now.

## TODO:
- The folder that the script creates currently does nothing, make it save data from the current event
- Make it work with multiple pages
